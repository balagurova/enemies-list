          <h2>Undesirable organisations</h2>
          <p><code class="red">Undesirable organisations,</code> according to the federal law, includes foreign civil society organisations which represent a threat to the foundations of the constitutional order and security of the Russian
            Federation. This status means a total ban on their work in the country and any cooperation with them by Russian organisations and citizens under a threat of criminal persecution. In recent years, the human rights based work of People in
            Need, the European Platform for Democratic Elections, the Prague Civil Society Center and the Association of Schools of Political Studies of the Council of Europe has already been prohibited in the country.</p>

          <h2>Foreign agents</h2>
          <p><code class="red">Оrganizations</code> or <code class="blue">individuals</code> engaging in political activity and receiving foreign funding must register as foreign agent. Once placed on the list, organizations and individuals are
            required to make financial disclosures four times a year detailing all sources of income. They must also append a disclaimer to all publications and social media posts identifying themselves as foreign agents. Failure to do so is
            punishable by fines of hundreds of thousands or millions of rubles. Many organisations suppose that the law on “foreign agents” violates both Russia’s Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p>Nasiliu.net offers assistance and support to victims of domestic violence in Russia. On December 29, 2020, the Russian Ministry of Justice labeled the anti-domestic violence group “Nasiliu.net” (No to Violence) as a “foreign agent”. The
            decision is based on the fact that Vosiliu.net was politically active because it published materials “criticizing the persecution of non-profit organizations,” wrote about the persecution of LGBT people and advocated the adoption of a law
            on domestic violence. </p>
          <p><code class="grey">«I was insanely hurt. On that day [December 29, when the decision came out], my phone was cut off from morning to evening. In general, this does not happen to me, but when I started talking, I immediately cried. <…> I
                don’t want to take the decision as logical, and all forms of support like “Welcome to the club of decent organizations” didn’t really reassure me. You can calm yourself down as you like, but I know for sure that I am not a “foreign
                agent”, I do nothing in the interests of another state, I work in the interests of myself as a citizen of the country and people who come to us for help every day. I don't want to live in a world where we train ourselves to call black
                white and vice versa.» – NGO’s co-founder Anna Rivina</code>
