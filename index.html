          <h2>Political prisoners</h2>
          <p>Political prisoners in today's Russian Federation are very different people. There are people imprisoned because of who they are (sexual orientation, ethnic, national, social origin etc.) or what they believe (<code
              class="red">religious</code>, <code class="blue">political or other conscientiously held beliefs</code>). There are civil and political activists persecuted for their activities, and there are those who were imprisoned for participating
            in scientific exchange of information or reposting on a social network. There are people who have literally become hostages, that is, imprisoned because they refused to stipulate others or in order to influence their relatives and
            friends, but there are completely accidental victims of the state repressive mechanism.</p>
          <p>One of the story is <code class="outline">DOXA</code> which is the most well-known student publication in Russia. Four young journalists faced three years in jail for supporting students during peaceful protests. They were being
            prosecuted to end their activities as independent journalists
            and critics of the current government, as well as intimidating society as a whole and preventing citizens, and especially young people, from exercising their inalienable political rights. Currently, the whole DOXA stuff is under house
            arrest, awaiting a trial. All they have done was to do their job.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="3">
          <h2>Undesirable organisations</h2>
          <p><code class="red">Undesirable organisations,</code> according to the federal law, include foreign civil society organisations which represent a threat to the foundations of the constitutional order and security of the Russian
            Federation. This status means a total ban on their work in the country and any cooperation with them by Russian organisations and citizens under a threat of criminal persecution. In recent years, the human rights based work of <code
              class="outline">People in
              Need</code>, <code class="outline">the European Platform for</code> <code class="outline"> Democratic Elections</code>, <code class="outline">the Prague Civil Society</code> <code class="outline"> Center</code> and <code
              class="outline">the Association of Schools of</code> <code class="outline">Political Studies of the Council of Europe</code> has already been prohibited in the country. </p>
          <p>A prominent investigative news website <code class="outline">Proekt</code> had to suspend operations immediately when it became the first media outlet which was added to the list of “undesirable organisations.“ The Russian State chose
            the moment when the Project leader, Roman Badanin was abroad and opened a criminal investigation against him. That is how they banish people from the country even if the Constitution expressly forbids it. The Project team promised to
            continue their investigations. <code class="outline">“And once again we thank everyone for</code> <code class="outline">their support. Journalism is not a crime!</code>"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" data-step="4">
          <h2>Foreign agents</h2>
          <p>This list includes <code class="red">organizations</code> or <code class="blue">individuals</code> engaging in political activity and receiving foreign funding. Once placed on the list, organizations and individuals are
            required to make financial disclosures four times a year detailing all sources of income and spendings. They must also append a disclaimer to all publications and social media posts identifying themselves as foreign agents. Failure to do
            so is
            punishable by fines or sentences. Many organisations suppose that the law on “foreign agents” violates both Russia’s Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p><code class="outline">No to Violence (Nasiliu.net)</code> offers assistance and support to victims of domestic violence in Russia. The decision is based on the fact that the organizations criticized the persecution of non-profit
            organizations, wrote
            about the persecution of LGBT people and advocated the adoption of a law on domestic violence. NGO’s co-founder Anna Rivina shared her
            feelings about the decision: <code class="outline">«I was insanely</code> <code class="outline">hurt. In general, this does not happen to me, but</code> <code class="outline"> when I would start talking, I would immediately</code> <code
              class="outline">cry. <…> I know for sure that I am not a “foreign</code> <code class="outline">agent”,I do nothing in the
              interests of another</code> <code class="outline">state, I work in the interests of myself as a</code> <code class="outline">citizen of thecountry and people who come to us</code> <code class="outline">for help every day.» </code></p>
